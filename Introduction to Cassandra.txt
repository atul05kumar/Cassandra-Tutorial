Introduction:

1. Cassandra is a distributed database from apache.
2. It is highly scalable.
3. High availability with no single points of failure.
4. It is a type of NoSQL database. Thus does not have any fixed schema and very simple query language.
5. It does not guarantee ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
6. It is eventually consistent.
7. Each node in cassandra cluster is same, and can serve requests.
8. If nodes return different values, then most recent value is returned and a read repair is performed.


Components of cassandra :

Node : It is the place where the data is stored.
Data Center : It is a collection of related nodes.
Cluster : Collection of one or more data centers.
Commit log : Crash recovery machenism, every write operation is written in cassandra.
Mem-Table : mem-table is memory resident data structre. after commit log, data is written to mem-table.
SSTable : Stored data flushed from mem-table.
Bloom filter : Non-deterministic algorithms to test whether an element is member of a set.
